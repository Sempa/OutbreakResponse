\textbf{Background}

Plague is a zoonotic disease caused by a bacteria found in rodents (1).
Individuals who are infected with plague usually manifest symptoms after
an incubation period of three to seven days. There are three main forms
of the plague disease: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic (2).
Transmission of the plague infection is through bites of an infected
rodent or inhalation of infected human respiratory droplets (1). It was
once a dreaded disease in India and claimed nearly 13 000 000 lives
between the years 1898 and 1994 (2,3). This disease has occurred in
India since the sixteenth century(2).

\textbf{Case definition}

Plague diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory diagnosis which can either
be by the isolation of Y. pestis from a clinical specimen or a
significant (fourfold or more) change in paired serum antibody titer to
\emph{Y. pestis} F1 antigen (4).

\textbf{Symptoms}

Symptoms of pneumonic plague include fever, headache, development of
pneumonia within a short space of time, followed by shortness of breath,
chest pain and cough. The patient may progress to respiratory failure
and shock if not treated within 2 to 4 days. If not treated, pneumonic
plague can be fatal (5).

\textbf{Prevention}

Currently, there is no vaccine for plague. People who came into direct
contact with infectious people must take antibiotics for seven days to
decrease chances of being infected (5). Patients who suspect they might
be infected with plague must wear surgical masks to prevent spreading
the diseases. Plague is usually caused by rodents and fleas, as part of
prevention, people are encouraged to reduce rodent habitats around them
and to keep fleas off their pets (6).

\textbf{Situation update}

We report on the progression of the recent pneumonic plague outbreak in
a community in northeast India which commenced on 12 October 2019. The
community has a population of 302 people. Between the 12th of October
2019 and 29th of November 2019, there were 189 reported cases, 160
confirmed cases and 29 probable cases. The outbreak has caused 24 deaths
to date.

The first case of the plague outbreak of India was detected on 11-Oct-19
and reached it's peak on 6-Nov-19. Majority 85\% out of 189 plague cases
were Lab confirmed.

\includegraphics{Plague_SitRep_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf}

\textbf{Data needs}\\
We need genomic data on confirmed cases to study transmission patterns
in the dataset and GIS data to study the geographical distribution of
the cases in Himachal Pradesh, India.
